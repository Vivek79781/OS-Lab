Heuristic Report:Squashbug

In this part, our group has used the time taken by the processes in the tree of the given pid upto the root. We have suggested the pid as culprit which is having the maximum difference of time from its children as the bug. This heuristic is giving accurate results for the example test case we created. The sb command will print the whole parent tree upto the pid 1 and print the user time and the system time. Now we will check the differnce of the total time,i.e. usertime+CPU time, for each pid and its parent. After this we will find the culprit which will be having the maximum difference with its children.

Justification:
We know from our knowledge that some process is creating issues to our pc. Now the main isssue of this problem will be the root process which is generating such processes again and again and going to sleep. So this program's children will be taking much higher resources than its parent as its parent is not doing much but the children are using lots of resources. But all the children, next level childrem, and so on, will be running for much larger time and spawning multiple processes. This will make the difference highest for the culprit process and it's children but the difference for its children and sub children will not be that high. So in most cases this will try to give the accurate results of the culprit process according to us.
